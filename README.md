# Virasoro Bootstrap

This repository contains a set of Julia notebooks which aim at solving bootstrap equations for 2D Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) with Virasoro symmetry. Bootstrap equations can be

* Crossing symmetry equations for 4 point functions on the sphere.
* Modular invariance equations for 1 point functions on the torus.

## Notebooks

* CFTdata.ipynb ; defines the central charge, conformal dimensions and fields in various parametrisations
